# What is ADMET and why it matters in drug discovery

ADMET stands for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity.
It describes how a drug behaves inside the human body and is a critical factor
in determining whether a compound can become a successful medicine.

## Absorption

Absorption refers to how a drug enters the bloodstream after administration.
For orally administered drugs, this depends on properties such as solubility,
permeability, and chemical stability.

## Distribution

Distribution describes how a drug spreads from the bloodstream to tissues and
organs. Factors such as plasma protein binding and tissue affinity influence
this process.

## Metabolism

Metabolism involves the chemical modification of a drug, primarily by enzymes
in the liver. Metabolic stability affects both drug efficacy and safety.

## Excretion

Excretion is the removal of the drug and its metabolites from the body, mainly
through the kidneys or bile. Poor excretion can lead to accumulation and
toxicity.

## Toxicity

Toxicity refers to harmful effects caused by the drug. Many promising compounds
fail in late-stage development due to unacceptable toxicity profiles.

## Why ADMET matters in modern drug discovery

A large fraction of drug candidates fail not because they lack activity against
a target, but because they have poor ADMET properties. As a result, ADMET
prediction is now integrated early into computational drug discovery workflows,
including machine learning-based virtual screening.

## Summary

ADMET properties determine whether a biologically active compound can become a
safe and effective drug. Understanding and predicting ADMET behavior early can
save significant time and resources in drug development.
